# 📊 Sales & Customer Performance Dashboards — Tableau Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a complete Tableau BI solution built with two fully interactive dashboards — a **Sales Dashboard** and a **Customer Dashboard**.  
The goal is to analyze year-over-year performance, highlight key trends, and understand customer behavior through clean visuals, KPIs, and dynamic interactions.

Both dashboards are connected through navigation buttons, include a show/hide filter panel, and allow users to explore the data in depth with intuitive filtering options.

## 🧩 What I Did in This Project

### **Sales Dashboard**
I designed a sales performance dashboard that tracks key metrics such as **Total Sales**, **Total Profit**, and **Total Quantity**, comparing the current year with the previous year.  
Monthly trend charts were created for each KPI, highlighting the strongest and weakest performing months.  
I built a comparative view of **product subcategory performance** for both years and created a detailed **weekly sales & profit analysis**, including average weekly values and week-by-week performance highlights.

### **Customer Dashboard**
The customer dashboard provides a breakdown of customer activity, featuring metrics such as **Total Customers**, **Sales per Customer**, and **Total Orders** (current year vs previous year).  
I created monthly customer trend lines, a **customer order distribution** visualization, and a comprehensive **Top 10 Customers by Profit** table including rank, orders, sales, profit, and last order date.

### **Design & Interactivity**
To enhance usability, I implemented:
- A **show/hide filter panel** with icon buttons  
- **Navigation buttons** to switch between dashboards  
- **Interactive charts** that act as filters  
- A **dynamic year selector** allowing users to view any year in the dataset  
- Filters for **category, subcategory, region, state, and city**

These elements make the dashboard clean, flexible, and easy to explore.
